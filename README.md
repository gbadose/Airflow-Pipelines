# Airflow-Pipelines
Airflow coordinates movements among data storage and processing tools. The software is **not** a data processing framework. Nothing is stored in memory.

#### Airflow's Core Components:
### Airflow's Core Components:
1) Scheduler - Orchestrates the execution of jobs on a trigger or schedule.
2) Work Queue - Used by the scheduler to deliver tasks that need to be run to the workers.
3) Worker Processes - The tasks are defined in the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). When the worker completes a task, it will reference the queue to process more work until no further work remains.
4) Database - Stores the workflow's metadata, e.g. credentials, connections, history, and configuration.
5) Web Interface - A control dashboard for users and maintainers.
An Airflow DAG is comprised of operators that define the atomic steps of work. In this project, I developed custom operators that perform frequently used procedures and allow for multiple use cases. One example is the `LoadDimensionOperator`. 
Each operator performs one definite task, e.g. load data from S3 to redshift. This both allows for parallelization, which decreases the required time to complete the procedure, and simplifies debugging/monitoring. Well-defined operators improve transparency and provide more information when resolving bugs.
### Sparkify's DAG Diagram

The diagram above visualizes the DAG's workflow. Each rectangle represents an operator/task. The arrows demonstrate dependencies. Meanwhile, the `Create_tables` operator functions independently.
The diagram also shows multi-purpose operators that are dynamic and work in parallel. In addition to performing ETL, the DAG coordinates a data quality check. The `Run_data_quality_checks` ensures that NULL values do not exist for any of the Redshift tables' primary keys, e.g. `artist_id` and `song_id`.
